Mair has made just one try in his 20 appearances.\n\nMair, born in Belfast and raised in Dublin, has been a key figure in the Irish team since its inception in 2004 but was only recently introduced to the attention she has now become.\n\nNiamh Mair is back for her third Olympics after helping the Ireland win gold at the 1998 Sydney Games\n\nAfter a first half performance which saw her score in a minute 45 seconds at the 2004 London Games, the reigning world champion is returning to her best with two Olympic golds.\n\nHer record since then is impressive too. In 10 Olympics, she is second to Mair (14).\n\nAfter going down 5-2 in the bronze match-up and then failing to score in the two other finals, Mair is back in the mix for another Olympic gold.\n\nAfter a good showing in the bronze match-up, but lacking in the final, she looks a genuine hope of the bronze medal she needs to seal the deal.\n\nMair, as ever, has impressed for Ireland\n\nDane Coles has another Olympic medal to share with his compatriot and there is no doubt the Australian has the skills and experience to challenge for gold.\n\nColes scored his fifth try in the last Olympic match-up against Canada at the 2008 world championships. The try was on target but it came at the wrong time and the momentum he built in the closing moments of the game was gone.\n\nColes, who came back and scored an upset victory in the last Olympic rugby match against Australia, has always been a player who wants to be more than just a great halfback. He has made the move to the other end of the field but it hasn't changed his approach in defence.\n\nAustralia's Scott Sevey (left) is the highest scorer by points of all the team's combined men and women medals\n\nOne of Coles' teammates in that squad for this Olympics will be Sam Underhill from South Africa. The 22-year-old had scored his first Olympic try in 2008 as a 13-year-old but he has not made his mark since.\n\nThis is a young man's game, with some of the best in the world ahead of him. But just because he's good doesn't mean he will always be a great athlete and Coles still needs to develop, though","name":"DavidHoade","email":"21c87c26ebee72f2fee3c99e68aa7054","website":"https://www.shamsbim.com/","date":"2020-06-21T09:53:27.288Z"}
